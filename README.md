# V:TM v5 dice
HTML Dice Roller attempting to encapsulate the dice logic for Vampire: The Masquerade v5

Basically, I'm planning to run a game with people who haven't played anything using a dice pool mechanic before, and the way Vampire: The Masquerade handles them is a bit complicated (the presence of two types of dice in the same roll, which potentially behave differently for min and max value rolls, for instance).

This project was also my attempt to figure out how to set up eslint (which I think I understand and like now) and npm (which I don't).
